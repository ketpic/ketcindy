KeTCindy
========

Version: 4.5.21

KeTCindy combines a plugin to Cinderella with free mathematical software
(R, Maxima, ...) to produce high-quality LaTeX graphics.
Using Cinderella to generate graphics in an interactive environment, the
generated image can be fine-tuned using KeTCindy commands embedded into
CindyScript, the scripting language of Cinderella. KeTCindy can be regarded
as a prominent scheme to establish an effective linkage between visualization
tools and editing tools. Moreover, KeTCindy enables the importation of data
calculated or simulated using other mathematical software such as Maxima,
Fricas, Risa/Asir and R, and to combine them with the graphical data, so that
an extremely wide range of mathematical objects can be presented.
