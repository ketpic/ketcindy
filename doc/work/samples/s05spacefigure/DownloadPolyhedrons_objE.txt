1) Data folder of polyhedra "polyhedrons_obj" is downloadable from the next website:
        http://mitani.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/polyhedron/

2) Store the folder into someplace, for example, "ketcindy" in the user home.

3) Open a cindy file and write scripts like the followings in the editor.
        Setdirectory(Dirhead+"polyhedrons_obj"); // Dirhead is "ketcindy" in the user home.
        poly=Readobj("r02.obj",["size=-3.5"]);
        Setdirectory(Dirwork);
